### Problem
We need software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard of the coronavirus against humanity.


### Solution
As we don't care so much about specific data, because this is how the society works anyway, we will only track 6 different events that area affecting people already infected (3 in favor of coronavirus & 3 in favor of humanity).

Coronavirus kills:
- 🙎‍♀️(a person)
- 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩(a couple)
- 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦(a family)


Survived to coronavirus:
- 🙎‍♀️(a person)
- 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩(a couple)
- 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦(a family)


The score always has seven characters. An example would be 001:002, where 001 stands for 🙎‍♀️ (one person) killed by the coronavirus and 002 for 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 (a couple) or 🙎‍♀️🙎‍♀️ (two persons) that survived to coronavirus.


### Rules
- Fork this repo or push a new branch using the name of the participants doing pairing as the branch name
- Do TDD
- Add/increment the value after every TDD loop (try to avoid testing implementation details)
- Do a commit after every green (this is important to fully understand the process)


### Test properties
Check which and how many of the test properties described in the [Test Desiderata](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-desiderata-94150638a4b3) have you achieved in order to understand how good your tests are and what trade-offs/concessions you ended up doing.
